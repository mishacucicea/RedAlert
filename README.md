Extreme Feedback Device for anything!

LightFeeD is a visual feedback device for anything. Capable of producing the whole RGB range of colours and beeping sounds. It is controlled over the internet with a simple API that can be called virtually from anywhere with an Internet connection.  The device is powered with a standard USB charger. The brightness is auto-adjusted depending on your environment so it's not too bright at night, and not too dim during  the day.
